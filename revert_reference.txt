For revrting immediate recent commit , below command can be used
git revert <SHA>
This will automatically create a revert commnit and will add into history.
If we want to revert without automatic-commit we can use below command :
git revert -n <SHA>

NOTE : Git Revert is to revert a specific commit as mentioned in the command. It will revert the changes made in that particular commit only. It will not revert any other commits.

If we want to revert multiple recent commits , this is one way :
git revert -n A
git revert -n B
git revert -n C
git revert -n D
where A,B,C,D are recent commits which we want to revert.
After the above commands , all reverted files will be in staged area.
Then , create a new commit as :
git commit -m "the commmit message for all of the reverted files in A , B , C & D commits"
